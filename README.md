# jsfl-flump
Convert Flash animations to Flump format using a jsfl Flash command.

# why jsfl-flump?
- The original Flump Adobe AIR app has not been updated for quite a while.
- It's missing support for custom tweening and other advanced stuff. 
- It won't compile using the newest Adobe AIR SDK
- It has loads of very annoying bugs

# how does it work?
- Open a FLA
- Run the flumpify command
- Profit!

# what's missing?
- Custom tweening is still missing but should not be too hard to integrate.
